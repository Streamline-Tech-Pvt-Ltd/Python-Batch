what is python?
 - Pythgon is programming language often use to build website and software and analyze data
 - Python is an simple,dynamic,interpreter,high level language and programming language
 - it is developed by 1991 by Guido van Russam
 

simple :  python has easy to learn and their syntax is simple
dynamic: python is dynamic mean is does not need to declare variable and their type
interpreted : that means the code is executed line by line which make easier to find debugging
high level language : high level language means programmer is read and write easily
General purpose : python is use ton various purpose to developed any application 
                   like as game Development,
                           web Development
                           software Development
                           data analytics
                           data science  etc.

what is comment?

 -A note in the code that Python does not execute.
   -sinle line comment : write starting with Hash(#)    
   -Double line comment : a)Write in the double cote ("""___""")
                          b)Write in the single cote ('''___''')

what is Indentation?
          - Indentation means adding space(tabs)nat beggining of line of code
   -it makes code clean and readable
   min space = 1
   max space = 4(1 tab)

what is variable?

  -variable is one type of container where we can store the value
  -ex. num = 10   (num is a variable and 10 is value)
  
   rule of define variables? 
   - a)var name always start with charecter
   - b)var name cant start with number
   - c)it can be alphanumeric
   - d)can use underscore:   #var_name =1234
                             #_a = 10
   - e)no charecter limit


what is keywords?
   
   - keywordsis a special words in a programming language to perform specific tasks.
   - ex. def , for , in , if , import etc.

   
    #keyword module 
    -program for the keyword
 '''
  import keyword as kw     #dont save file name as a module name
  keywords = kw.kwlist
  print(keywords)
  print(len(keywords))   '''

what is operator?

  Operator : used to perform operation of values and variable 
   

   # ex- 
 # a = 1
 # b = 2
 # print (a + b)

 # here the a and b is operands(variable) , 1 and 2 is values
 # + is a operator


 # Types of operator:

 # 1. Arithematic operator (+,-, ,/,%,*,//)
 # 2.Assisgnment opeartor (=,+=, -=, *=,/=, and all arithmetic operators are used)
 # 3.Comparison/Relational opeartor (==, !=, >, < ,>=, <=)
 # 4.Logical operator (and,or,not)
 # 5.Identity operator(is, is not)
 # 6.Membership operator(in, not in)
 # 7.Bitwise opeartor(&, |, ~, ^)


   1. Arithematic operator (+,-, ,/,%,*,//)
      
         it is use to done basic operation in python like as addition ,subtraction etc.
         ex- 
          # a = 1
          # b = 2
          # print (a + b)

    2.Assisgnment opeartor (=,+=, -=, *=,/=, and all arithmetic operators are used)
           
           -it is use to perform operations in python

           ex.- b) +=  :
                      # a = 1
                      # a += 10           (a = a + 10)
                      # print(a)

  3.Comparison/Relational opeartor (==, !=, >, < ,>=, <=)

     -Comparison operators are used to compare two values.
     -They always return True or False.
     -ex:
          <  :show less than
          a = 10
          b = 12
          print(a < b)

   
    4.Logical operator (and,or,not)

      

  a) and :
 
      0 1 = 0
      1 0 = 0
      1 1 = 1
      0 0 = 0
              
     a = 10
     b = 20
     print(a>=9 and b<=20)


  b) or :

       0 1 = 1
       1 0 = 1
       1 1 = 1
       0 0 = 0

     a = 10
     b = 20
     print(a>20 or b<=21)

  c) not :

        0 = 1
        1 = 0

     a = 10
     print(not a > 12 )

 5.Identity operator(is, is not)

     a) is : it operator check to both variable refer to one object or not 

         a = 3
         b = a
         print(a is 3)


      b) is not : means both objects are different in memory
     (store variable value in different location so those are not same )

         a = [1,2,3]
         b = [1,2,3]
         print (a is not b)


      
     6.Membership operator(in, not in)


      a)  in :

       number = [1,2,3,4]

         if 1 in number:
         print("number is in a string")



      b)  not in :  

          number = [1,2,3,4]

       if 7 not in number:
       print("number is not in a string")



  7.Bitwise opeartor(&, |, ~, ^)

      a)  &  :and(use a truth table)

         a = 5         101
         b = 3         011
         print (a & b)


     b)  |  : or 
         a = 5         
         b = 3        
         print (a | b)
                #    (addition of all bits means 4+2+1 = 7)



     c)   ~   :negation

         a = 5
         print (~5)

        formula : -(a + 1)

     d)   ^  :xor  (if two bits are differ result get 1 and two bits are same result will be 0)
         
          1 ^ 1 = 0
          0 ^ 0 = 0
          1 ^ 0 = 1
          0 ^ 1 = 1


         a = 5         
         b = 3         
         print (a ^ b)
                # (answer is 6)

what is conditional Statements ?

     - it is use to make decision in python



  #  if - elif - else

    # if : if is use to single condition
        
        age = 18
        if age >= 18:
        print("You are eligible to work in company")



    # if - else : for the 2 condition


           age = int(input("Enter Your age :- "))
           if age > 18 :  
              print("you can apply for the company")
           else:
             print("you cant apply for the company")



    # if - else -elif   :(for more then 2 condition)

        marks = int(input("Enter Your Marks :- "))

         if marks > 75 :
             print("Grade A")
    
         elif marks > 50:
             print("Grade B") 
    
          elif marks > 35:
               print("Grade C")
    
          else:
               print("Fail")
     
         - we have use elif condition many times

 

what is indexing and slicing ?

 Indexing:
     - fetch sinle element

          There are 2 types:

              # 1.positive indexing 
              # 2.negative indexing



     # Positive indexing : start with 0,1,2,...N


         ex
 
               0  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 = positive index 
         num = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8] 

         print(num[1])



     # Negative Indexing
                   -8 -7 -6 -5 -4 -3 -2 -1  = negative index 
             num = [1 ,2 ,3 ,4 ,5 ,6 ,7 ,8] 
 
              print(num[-4])



 Slicing
          -fetch more tha two elements

        ex 1:-

         num = [11,22,33,44,55,66,77,88] 
           print(num[2:5])
                              #(indexing from 2 to 4 )


        ex 2:-

           num = [11,22,33,44,55,66,77,88] 

         print(num[   1     :  8       :  2  ])
                 start value:end value :step value

what is Data type?

  - data type is a type of variable thet store the value in python

  thre are two types:-
                       1)primitive
                       2)non primitive/ collective

    1)primitive :

        a. int - store only integer/whole number (ex. a = 10)

        b.float - store only float (ex.10.00)

        c. string- store text (ex. name ="rahul")

        d.boolean = store true or false

    2)Collective :
              -store multiple value in one variable


        a. list - 
            -denoted by square brackets[]
            - empty list denote by :[]
            - access single elemengt in list
            - various method use in list:-insert(),remove(),pop(),sort(),etc.

                 ex:list=[1,2,3,4]
                    list.insert[4,5]
                     print(list(1))



         list is:
          mutable: means we are modified in list,or valuecan be change after creation
          order  : maintain order in which element are added
          indexed: have a theire position number start form 0
          duplicate: same value can be use more times
         

        b. Dictionary:-
            -stores values in key–value pairs.
            -denoted by {}
            -format {"key" : "value"}
            -key is a unique that means it not a duplicate
            -value must be duplicate

          Dictionary is:
          mutable: means we are modified in list,or valuecan be change after creation
          order : it is order 
          duplicate: key-dont allow
                     value-allow  
                
                ex:-

                 student = {"name": "Rahul", "age": 21 }
                 print(student["name"])
